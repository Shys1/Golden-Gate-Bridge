				<p>The Golden Gate Bridge is located on US Highway 101, providing a vital link between the City and County of San Francisco and the counties to the north. The Bridge does not have a physical address but it can be easily found on Google Maps or other online map services.

Parking is extremely limited at the southeast and northeast visitor areas of the Bridge, and ongoing construction projects in the area may temporarily close roads leading to the Bridge. Visitors are strongly encouraged to use a mode other than a personal vehicle to get to the Bridge. These include public transit, a tour bus, a ridesharing service such as Uber or Lyft, a rental bike, on foot, etc. </p>
